ISTIO TRAINING &amp; OPENSHIFT SERVICE MESH TRAINING (EX328) – HANDS-ON, CERTIFICATION-FOCUSED
Modern cloud-native applications demand resilience, security, observability, and traffic control at scale. This is exactly where <a href= "https://krnetworkcloud.org/course/istio-openshift-service-mesh-training/">Istio Training</a> and OpenShift Service Mesh play a critical role. 
The Istio Course & <a href= "https://krnetworkcloud.org/course/istio-openshift-service-mesh-training/">OpenShift Service Mesh Training</a> (EX328) by KR Network Cloud is designed for professionals who want real production-grade service mesh skills, not just theoretical concepts.
This istio training focuses on hands-on implementation, troubleshooting, and certification readiness aligned with the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Building Resilient Microservices exam.
<h3>WHY ISTIO SERVICE MESH SKILLS MATTER IN 2025</h3>
As Kubernetes adoption grows, managing microservices without a service mesh becomes risky and inefficient.
With Istio on OpenShift, organizations can:
<li>Secure service-to-service communication using mTLS</li>
<li>Implement traffic shifting, canary deployments, and retries</li>
<li>Gain deep observability with metrics, logs, and tracing</li>
<li>Enforce enterprise-grade security policies</li>
<li>Improve application reliability without changing application code</li>

This is why Istio Service Mesh training is becoming a mandatory skill for:
<li>OpenShift Administrators</li>
<li>Platform Engineers</li>
<li>SREs</li>
<li>DevOps & Cloud Engineers</li>
